# Test: consensus recovery on cycle failure
# ============================================================
# Verifies the hardening in auto-loop.sh: a cycle that exits non-zero
# but wrote a VALID consensus keeps it (work preserved); only an
# INVALID consensus triggers restore from backup.
#
# Root cause this guards against: Claude returns subtype:"success"
# with is_error:true and exits 1 on a transient subagent/MCP error.
# The old code unconditionally called restore_consensus, throwing away
# a valid relay baton. validate_consensus is the real corruption gate.
#
# Mirrors validate_consensus() from auto-loop.sh on purpose so the
# test fails loudly if the production contract drifts.
#
# Run: ./tests/test-consensus-failure-recovery.sh
